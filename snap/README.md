# Build SNAP Package

#### 1. Install snapcraft
```snap install snapcraft```

#### 2. Get started
run ```snapcraft init```

The above command generates a snapcraft.yaml file in the snap directory. We must replace that file with the content of snapcraft.yaml_template.

#### 3. Build snap
run ```snapcraft``` in the iteexe directory.
